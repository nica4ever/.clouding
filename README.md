# .clouding
Personal cloud engineering project

# Context 
This is a personal cloud project in which I aim to create a full production setup

## Prerequisites

For the purpose of this build I will use Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL).

I will install RHEL on four servers(check https://www.hetzner.com/). The settings for the install are nothing special and because this is work in progress I haven't managed to fully optimize the settings. I will explain in detail the configuration of each system.
